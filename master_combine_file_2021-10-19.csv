KPaul asserts that the requirement for offerors to submit with phase I proposals either International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification 9001:2015 quality management systems and/or ISO certification 20243:2018 open trusted technology provider standards is unduly restrictive of competition. KPaul further protests that the agency failed to follow the terms of the solicitation when it eliminated the firm from the competition without evaluating KPaul's phase I proposal because KPaul did not provide an ISO certification. Finally, KPaul protests that the agency could not reject KPaul's proposal for failing to provide an ISO certification, without referring the matter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) for a certificate of competency (COC) assessment.

In its protests, Hendall challenged the agency's evaluation under the technical and past performance factors, and the agency's best-value tradeoff decision. The protester also asserted that the agency engaged in disparate treatment of Hendall and IQ Solutions by providing IQ Solutions more substantive information regarding its evaluation in IQ's debriefings, and more details about its past performance during discussions. Hendall requests that we reconsider our decision to the extent it dismissed these issues.

Odyssey challenged the issuance of a task order to Millennium Engineering and Integration, LLC, by the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service, under task order request for proposals (RFP) No. 47QFPA21R0009, which was issued for advisory and assistance services. The protester alleged that Millennium improperly certified its small business status and that the agency improperly awarded the task order to Millennium knowing that it was not an eligible small business. The protester further argued that the agency unreasonably evaluated Odyssey's proposal, unequally evaluated offerors, improperly waived page limitations for the awardee, and failed to perform a proper best-value tradeoff. After our Office advised the parties at an outcome prediction alternative dispute resolution (ADR) conference that GAO would likely sustain the protest, GSA stated that it would take corrective action, and we dismissed the protest as academic.

GOV also requests that we recommend that it be reimbursed certain additional costs associated with filing and pursuing a bid protest challenging the award of the lease under the RFP to Carnegie Management and Development Corporation. Following an earlier decision from our Office sustaining GOV's protest and recommending that it be reimbursed the aforementioned costs, GOV submitted its certified claim for such costs to the VA. The agency has agreed to pay a total of $197,730.50 of this claim and our decision here addresses only the disputed portion of the claim, as detailed below.
