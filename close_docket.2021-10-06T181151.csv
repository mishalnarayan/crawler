Tata America International Corporation (TAIC), of New York, New York, protests the terms of solicitation No. 75N98121R00001, which was issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), for the award of multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs) for information technology services, known as Chief Information Officer-Solutions and Partners (CIO-SP4). The protester argues that the solicitation's corporate experience requirements, which require offerors to identify their customers, are unduly restrictive of competition because certain of the commercial contracts the protester wishes to cite in its proposal contain confidentiality provisions that prohibit disclosure of the information required by the request for proposals (RFP).

The protester argues that the solicitation's requirement that a joint venture competing for the award, as opposed to the members of the joint venture, must have a top secret facility clearance is inconsistent with statutory and regulatory provisions concerning the evaluation of the capabilities of the members of small business joint ventures.

Apex Transit Solutions, LLC, a small business of Cleveland, Ohio, requests that our Office recommend that the firm be reimbursed the reasonable costs of filing and pursuing its protests of the contract awards to GC Logistics, LLC, a service-disabled veteran-owned small business, of Ridgeland, Mississippi. The contract awards were made under requests for quotations (RFQ) Nos. 36C25019Q0494 and 36C25020Q0093, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for ambulette transportation services for the VA Cleveland Healthcare System located in Cleveland, Ohio. Apex contends that the VA failed to properly implement multiple corrective actions taken in response to protests related to this procurement. In its most recent protests, Apex challenged the agency's evaluation of past performance and price, the agency's best-value tradeoff determination, and alleged disparate treatment.

Babel Street, Inc., a small business of Reston, Virginia, protests the award of a contract to Dataminr, Inc., of New York, New York, under request for proposals (RFP) No. FA7014-20-R-0005, which was issued by the Department of the Air Force for the publicly available information alerting Department of Defense enterprise license subscription (PADELS) service. The protester contends that the Air Force conducted a flawed evaluation of Babel Street's past performance record, applied unstated evaluation criteria as part of the technical evaluation, and erred in its best-value tradeoff by selecting Dataminr's higher-priced proposal for award and not adequately documenting the agency's tradeoff determination. Protest at 2-3.

Protection Strategies challenged the issuance of a task order to Armada Ltd., by the Department of Justice (DOJ) under request for quotations (RFQ) No. 15JPSS20Q00000014, which was issued for various security services. The protester alleged that the agency engaged in unequal discussions, improperly evaluated the awardee's quotation, relied on a flawed independent government cost estimate (IGCE), failed to perform a required price realism analysis, and made award based on an erroneous best-value tradeoff decision. After our Office advised the parties that GAO would likely sustain the protest during an outcome prediction alternate dispute resolution (ADR) conference, DOJ indicated that it would take corrective action and we dismissed the protest as academic.

Shertech Pharmacy Piedmont, LLC (Shertech), of Kernersville, North Carolina, requests that we reconsider our decision, Shertech Pharmacy, B-419069, Oct. 29, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 336, denying its protest challenging the terms of request for quotations (RFQ) No. 36C24620Q0897, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the provision of radiopharmaceutical products to the VA medical center in Durham, North Carolina. Shertech argued that the RFQ's requirement that the successful contractor be located within a 50-mile radius of the VA's facility is unduly restrictive of competition. We denied the protest because the VA demonstrated that its geographical requirement was reasonably necessary to meet its needs. The requester argues our decision contained factual errors that warrant modification of our prior decision.

The Department of the Army requests reconsideration of our decision, AES UXO, LLC, B-419150, Dec. 7, 2020, 2020 CPD ¶ 395, sustaining in part a protest filed by AES UXO, LLC, of New Orleans, Louisiana, protesting the terms of request for quotations (RFQ) No. W911SA21Q3008. The RFQ sought unexploded ordnance clearance services at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. We sustained the protest, finding that the RFQ was unduly restrictive of competition because it limited the evaluation of relevant experience and past performance to instances where the firm submitting the quotation had performed as a prime contractor or member of a joint venture, which precluded consideration of AES's relevant experience as a subcontractor. The Army argues that our decision was based on factual and legal error and an incomplete record.

Elemental Innovation Inc., a small business of Newton, New Hampshire, doing business as Halo Maritime Defense Systems (Halo), requests that our Office recommend that it be reimbursed the costs associated with filing and pursuing its protest. Halo filed its protest against the award of a contract to Oceanetics, Inc., a small business of Annapolis, Maryland, doing business as Truston Technologies (Truston), under request for proposals (RFP) N00024-20-R-6303, which was issued by the Department of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command, for port security barriers (PSBs). The protester contended that the agency failed to investigate apparent organizational conflicts of interest (OCIs); conducted a flawed technical evaluation, including the failure to consider prohibitions on the procurement of certain PSB designs; used an unsound internal price estimate; and did not engage in meaningful discussions with Halo, insofar as the discussions relied on the flawed price estimate. After our Office advised the parties at the conclusion of an outcome prediction alternate dispute resolution (ADR) conference that GAO would likely sustain the protest, the Navy indicated that it would take corrective action and we dismissed the protest as academic.

JSR argues that the agency improperly excluded its proposal based on its suspension from federal contracting because, the protester contends, the suspension and debarment provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) do not apply to the award of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts; the FAR provisions permit agencies to award new IDIQ contracts to suspended contractors; and the RFP's guaranteed minimum is insufficient to create a binding contract.

Navient Solutions, LLC, of Wilmington, Delaware, protests the award of multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts to Edfinancial Services, LLC; F.H. Cann & Associates LLC; MAXIMUS Federal Services Inc.; Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority (MOHELA); and Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corporation (Trellis), pursuant to request for proposals (RFP) No. 91003119R0008, issued by the Department of Education, Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA), for contact center operations and back-office processing activities encompassing the entire student aid life cycle. The protester contends that the contract offered by the agency contained terms and conditions that are materially different from the RFP and that exceed the agency's minimum requirements such that the agency was required to issue an RFP amendment. The protester also contends that the agency failed to perform a price realism analysis, and that the common pricing established by the agency is unrealistically low.
